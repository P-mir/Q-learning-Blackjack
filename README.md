## Introduction

The optimal action to play is given by the Bellman equation

In a second time it is demonstrated that the agent can learn to leverage a [simple card counting strategy](https://www.blackjack.org/blackjack-strategies/hi-lo-count/#:~:text=The%20Hi%2DLo%20Count%20strategy,(cards%202%2D6).)
 to improve its games and beat the casino.

## Instructions

Run the script Environment.R to launch the game.
